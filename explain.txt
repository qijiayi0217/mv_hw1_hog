In this image, we matched 10 feature points. Eight of them matched two calculator and the other two don't. After a carefully observation, about 5 feature points are matched correctly. So in this picture, the success rate is 50%.

I don't think it is sufficient to play the game. Because this picture is the best result and still under 50%. In other data set such as cards and other matches in cards2, the success rate is much lower. Some of the matches is really bad.

The reasons are list below:
	1. In folder cards, objects in different picture have some change on scale but hog method can not deal with the different scale of objects. But the scale-invariance is necessary in this game if we use the data set in folder cards.
	
	2. The rotation method for eliminating rotation effect might be not so good. Because we only select the dominated peak in histogram and determine the rotation angle. But this may produce a big error in some case. A better way is to select 3 most highest bins instead and fit them in a parabola.

	3. And 8 bins in a histogram is not enough to get a good result since the interval in this case will be pi/4. This angle interval is quite big and it will cause a huge amount of errors. If we have more bins such as 16 or more might make the result better.
